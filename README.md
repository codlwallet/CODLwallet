# CODL wallet

Introduction
In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, many users grapple with the daunting challenge of safeguarding their crypto assets, especially in the wake of substantial losses. Cold storage devices have emerged as a beacon of hope, promising to keep crypto assets secure by maintaining private keys offline. However, the high costs, specific hardware prerequisites, and limited recovery options of traditional cold storage devices have curtailed their mass adoption.

Introducing CODL Wallet.

Codl Wallet offers a fresh, secure, and private method for storing your digital assets. This entirely offline wallet ensures your private keys remain solely under your control, significantly reducing the risk of hackers accessing or misusing your digital assets. With over a billion people possessing spare phones or devices, Codl Wallet taps into this potential. We believe that Codl can democratize access to privacy and security for a broader audience, all without exacerbating the global e-waste dilemma.

Codl is open-source, compatible with popular wallets, and facilitates seamless connections to hot wallets via offline QR codes. Dive into the Codl experience today and be a part of the offline revolution.

## Features

Offline Private Key Storage: Codl Wallet stores your private keys offline, directly on your device, eliminating the need to trust third parties.
Device Compatibility: Codl Wallet is compatible with your existing devices, eliminating the need for additional hardware purchases.
Eco-friendly: By keeping your private keys offline, Codl Wallet contributes to a reduced carbon footprint.
Web3 App Connectivity via QR: Easily connect to Web3 apps using a QR code, streamlining access to funds and integration with your preferred apps.
Getting Started
To begin using Codl Wallet, fill out the testnet form. Following this, download the app from the App Store or Google Play. After installation, initiate a new wallet creation. This process involves selecting a username and password. Additionally, a passphrase can be used. While your password unlocks your wallet, the passphrase accesses a hidden wallet. This passphrase is session-specific and isn't stored on the device. In case of device loss, wallet restoration is possible using a seed phrase. We're also in the process of developing a decentralized recovery method using account abstraction features. After setting up, manage networks, add unlimited accounts, and name them as per your preference.

## Using Codl Wallet
Connect Codl Wallet to a hot wallet, such as Metamask or Rabby Wallet, using the 'connect wallet' button on the app's main page. Scan the QR code on the hot wallet to securely link via xpublickey. Once connected, monitor and manage your funds, facilitating sending, receiving, and swapping of cryptocurrency.

## Security
Codl Wallet prioritizes the security and privacy of your digital assets through:

Secure Enclave Storage: Private keys are encrypted and stored exclusively on your device, never online.
Passphrase: Applying a passphrase to your seed words generates a unique wallet. This passphrase is session-specific and is deleted after app closure, enhancing security in case of device compromise.
Biometric Authentication: Log in using fingerprint or facial recognition.
Login Password: Add an additional layer of security with a login password, bolstering protection against unauthorized access.
